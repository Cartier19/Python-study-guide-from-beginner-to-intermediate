<h1>Welcome to this mini python tutorial from beginner to intermediate.</h1>
<p>This study guide contains my study notes of python which were culled from the Sololearn app.<br>
It contains two modules: the beginner ad the intermediary module.<br>
Each module contains a note.txt file and various python files which contain examples on the various topics discussed in each module.<br>
You can clone this repository and add whatever information you feel is necessary, also feel free to add projects that people can work on, whether individually or as a group. All these should be added to separate branches.<br>
Just an advice, this isn't enough to  build you up but is just a stepping stone to build you up on your python journey. Get other materials to study, buy udemy courses and get projects to work on. I'll be dropping resources continually as I see them.
